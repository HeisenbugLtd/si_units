Utility library to pretty print physical values in properly scaled
[metric (SI) units](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/metric-si/si-units).

### Problem

Assuming you're writing software that deals with real world values (like
frequency, speed, distance, pressure, etc. pp.), at some point you probably
want to print values of such types.  To be nice to the user, such values should
be properly formatted.  Ada provides formatting libraries (like
`Float_Text_IO`, or even the simple `'Image` attribute) for that purpose, but
these do not scale input values, they plainly output whatever you give them in
whatever formatting you requested.  So, if you are using a base value of "m"
for your distance type, a distance of 42.0 km will be output as something like

`42000.000`

by some properly instantiated `Text_IO` package.  Often this is still quite
unsatisfactory, especially when dealing with very large or very small values,
so that representations with exponents (like `42.424242E-9`) will be used by
default.  So, what do you do?  Wrap up your own formatting subprograms, right?
No, of course not, not anymore! Instead ...

### Solution

... **Use SI_Units!**  It provides several `Image` function generics for
formatting such values.  What it does, is that it takes the given value into
consideration before converting it into a string and returning an appropriately
formatted string including the prefixed physical unit.

### Compiling SI_Units

SI_Units is designed as a library to be linked statically.  For this purpose, a
library project is provided:

```sh
gprbuild -p -P si_units.gpr
```

By default this builds an optimized version of the library with all runtime
checks enabled.  After compilation succeeded, you can install the library in
your `gnat` installation like this:

```sh
gprinstall -p -P si_units.gpr
```

Depending on how your GNAT installation is set up, the latter command may
require elevated privileges to write into the installation directory, so if
needed, prepend sudo </path/to/gnat/installation/>/bin/ to the gprinstall
instruction above.

After that, all you need is to add the line `with "si_units";` to your
project file and you're ready to go.

### Examples

So, in the example from the introductory paragraph, you would first instantiate
an appropriate `Image` subprogram for your `Distance` type:

```ada
function Image is new
   SI_Units.Metric.Float_Image (Item        => Distance,
                                Default_Aft => 3,
                                Unit        => SI_Units.Meter);
```

This instantiates the subprogram `Image` for the type `Distance`, the default
number of digits after the decimal point will be `3` and the unit name is `m`
(meter).

Then you can call this `Image` instantiated for your `Distance` type like this:

```ada
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (42000.0));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (4200.0));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (420.0));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (42.0));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (4.2));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (0.42));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (0.042));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (0.0042));
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (0.00042));
```

and you'll get:

```
42.000 km
4.200 km
420.000 m
42.000 m
4.200 m
420.000 mm
42.000 mm
4.200 mm
420.0 Âµm
```

Neat, isn't it?

`Default_Aft` is merely provided for convenience, the number of digits after
the decimal point can be specified for each call to `Image`:

`Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Image (4200.0, Aft => 1));`

will output

`4.2 km`

instead.

### (More) Examples

You may have noticed that the instantiation above used a package name
`SI_Units.Metric`.  Now, if you'd expect a child package named `Imperial`,
you'd be wrong.  After all, the library is called "SI Units", so sorry, I am
not supporting things like *foot pound per square inch*.  But, besides decimal
prefixes (what it usually called "metric"), there's also an official definition
for binary prefixes, good for your Megabits/s (Mebibits/s) connection speed and
your Terabytes (Tebibytes) of storage.  So yes, the other child package
hierarchy is `SI_Units.Binary` and provides a similar[1] functionality for
values that are better written with binary prefixes:

```ada
function Image is new
  SI_Units.Binary.Mod_Image (Item        => Transmission_Speed,
                             Default_Aft => 1,
                             Unit        => "byte/s");
```

### Scaling support

Sometimes, dealing with inputs from external sources means that values come in
different scales than the ones you're using internally.  For instance, the
[JSON API from openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) returns the
atmospheric pressure in hPa (hecto-Pascal), not in the base unit Pa.  Also, SI
defines kg as the base unit, not g(ram), so if you're using values in kg within
your program, you may need to convert such values to the prefixless version
before feeding it to their respective `Image` subprogram.

We got you covered, `SI_Units.Metric.Scaling` does that for you.  Actually from
any prefix into any other prefix.  So, if you need to convert a value given in
km into a value in mm, this got you covered.  Just be careful, you may easily
exceed the defined range of your type if you scale it around like a mad person.

### Unit names

Unit names given in instantiations are standard strings, except for a tiny,
little `Dynamic_Predicate` that states it can either be completely empty or
shall not start with control characters or white space.  For any proper use,
this predicate can be ignored.  I can't think of any use case that would
warrant the use of a vertical tab between the value and the actual unit.  In
fact, the `Image` subprograms are designed to work in a way that both will be
separated by a non-breaking space for better readability and to conform to what
[SI has to say about it](https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units).

For your convenience, all the names of the SI defined physical units are
declared in `SI_Units.Names`.


[1] There are no SI prefixes defined for absolute values less than one, so the
support for binary images is currently restricted to natural numbers.
